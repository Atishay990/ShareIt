# ShareIt
Something worth sharing? Go [open an issue](https://github.com/iiitv/ShareIt/issues/new).


## How this works 

* When you find something worth sharing, you open an issue. 
* **Title of the issue:** Basic headline to what you are sharing.
* **Description of the issue:** More information on your share and why you think it's good for the community.
* Opening an issue will send an e-mail to all those who are watching this repository. So they will get notified about your post.
